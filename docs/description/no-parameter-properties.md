Disallows parameter properties in class constructors.


Parameter properties can be confusing to those new to TS as they are less explicit
than other ways of declaring and initializing class members.

It can be cleaner to keep member variable declarations in one list directly above the class constructor
(instead of mixed between direct class members and constructor parameter properties).
        

Not configurable.
