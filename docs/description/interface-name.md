Requires interface names to begin with a capital 'I'

Makes it easy to differentiate interfaces from regular classes at a glance.


One of the following two options must be provided:

* `"always-prefix"` requires interface names to start with an "I"
* `"never-prefix"` requires interface names to not have an "I" prefix
