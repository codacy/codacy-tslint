In a binary expression, a literal should always be on the right-hand side if possible.
For example, prefer 'x + 1' over '1 + x'.


Expressions like `1 + x` are sometimes referred to as "Yoda" expressions because they read
opposite to how we would normally speak the expression.

Sticking to a consistent grammar for conditions helps keep code readable and understandable.
