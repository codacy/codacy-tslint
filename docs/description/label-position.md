Only allows labels in sensible locations.

This rule only allows labels to be on `do/for/while/switch` statements.


Labels in JavaScript only can be used in conjunction with `break` or `continue`,
constructs meant to be used for loop flow control. While you can theoretically use
labels on any block statement in JS, it is considered poor code structure to do so.

Not configurable.
